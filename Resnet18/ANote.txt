To make it convenient, I put the explanation of the programs of 'Resnet181Train.py', 'Resnet182train.py', 'Resnet183Train.py' and 'Resnet184Train.py' in the file 'Resnet181Train.py'. It is becasue that, except for the structure of the varients of the Resnet18, almost everything in those programs are the same. So, I concretely explain the programs in the file 'Resnet181Train.py'.

What's more, in the paper, we show the traning process of the LFR. It is simply made by changing the training stage and traning epoch in the program. So, I think there's no need to submit them here. Because the intact training epochs are 80, so the programs here all contains 80 epochs.

Similarly, I put the explanation of the programs of 'Resnet181ComputingLFR.py', 'Resnet182ComputingLFR.py', 'Resnet183ComputingLFR.py' and 'Resnet184ComputingLFR.py' in the file 'Resnet181ComputingLFR.py'. And in the same way, except for the imported model and the order number of the -1 and -2 hidden layers, almost everything in those programs are the same. So, I concretely explain the programs in the file 'Resnet181ComputingLFR.py'.
